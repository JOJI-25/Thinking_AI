**Thinking_AI** is a research framework implementing a "Cognitive Agent" based on principles from Computational Neuroscience. It bridges the gap between biological intelligence and artificial intelligence.

Unlike standard Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) models (like DQN or PPO) which are often static "Function Approximators," this system implements **dynamic, biologically plausible mechanisms**:
1.  **Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs):** Information is temporal (spike timing), not just spatial.
2.  **Neuromodulated Plasticity:** Learning happens online via local rules (Hebbian) modulated by global dopamine signals, avoiding biologically implausible Backpropagation-through-Time.
3.  **System 2 Deliberation:** The agent implements a "pause-and-think" loop, allowing it to simulate futures using a World Model before acting.

The architecture mimics the functional layout of the mammalian brain.

### 1. The BioAgent Data Flow
This diagram illustrates how sensory spikes compete for consciousness (Global Workspace) and how the brain switches between reflexive acting and predictive planning.

⚙️ Detailed Algorithmic MechanicsThe system operates in continuous time, discretized into steps ($dt$).1. Spiking Neuron Model (LIF)We use the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model to capture temporal dynamics.The membrane potential $V(t)$ of neuron $i$ evolves according to:$$ \tau_m \frac{dV_i}{dt} = -(V_i(t) - V_{rest}) + R \cdot \sum_{j} w_{ij} S_j(t) $$$\tau_m$: Membrane time constant (how fast voltage decays).$S_j(t)$: Incoming spikes from presynaptic neurons (0 or 1).Spike Condition: If $V_i(t) > V_{threshold}$, the neuron fires a spike ($S_i(t)=1$) and resets to $V_{reset}$.2. The Three-Factor Plasticity RuleStandard AI uses Backpropagation, which requires "freezing" the world to calculate gradients. Biology uses Eligibility Traces.Weight updates ($\Delta w$) depend on three factors:Presynaptic Spike: Neuron $j$ fired.Postsynaptic Spike: Neuron $i$ fired shortly after $j$ (Causal link).Dopamine (Reward): A global signal $D$ indicating success/failure.The Equation:$$ \frac{de_{ij}}{dt} = -\frac{e_{ij}}{\tau_e} + S_j(t) \cdot S_i(t) $$$$ \Delta w_{ij} = \eta \cdot e_{ij}(t) \cdot D(t) $$$e_{ij}$: The eligibility trace (a fading memory of "who fired together").$D(t)$: The reward or TD-error signal.$\eta$: Learning rate.Result: The network learns only when an action leads to a reward, reinforcing the specific synapses that caused that action.3. Global Workspace (Attention)The agent features a "Workspace" module.Competition: Multiple sensory modules (e.g., vision, memory) send spikes to the workspace.Bottleneck: Only the $k$ most active neurons in the workspace are allowed to fire ("Winner-Take-All").Broadcasting: The winners' spikes are sent back to all modules, effectively synchronizing the brain on a single "thought."4. System 2 ReasoningImplemented in agent.py, this loop triggers when the entropy (uncertainty) of the spike distribution is high.Step A (Inhibition): If uncertainty is high, the motor cortex is inhibited.Step B (Prediction): The current state vector is passed to the Transformer World Model (modules.py).Step C (Rollout): The model predicts $\hat{S}_{t+1}$ given action $a$.Step D (Evaluation): A value network estimates $V(\hat{S}_{t+1})$. If $V$ is negative (e.g., hitting a wall), the agent picks a different action internally before moving externally.📂 File StructureFileComponentDescriptionagent.pyBioAgentThe central class.
